 * @brief A statistic that is represented by a DD-Sketch. We take the implementation from the paper
 * "DD-Sketch: A fast and fully-mergeable quantile sketch with relative-error guarantees" by Charles Masson, Jee E. Rim, and Homin K. Lee.
 * (http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf)
 * For now, we do not perform any optimizations, such as the use of merging buckets together to reduce the memory requirements.
 * The authors state in the paper for Î±lpha = 0.01, a sketch of size 2048 can handle values from 80 microseconds to 1 year,
 * and cover all quantiles.
