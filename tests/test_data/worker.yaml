# ~~~ Physical Stream Configurations ~~~

# A Physical Stream may be associated with multiple Instances of a logicalStreamName, a physicalStreamName and a SourceType
# If no Physical Stream Config is given, the worker will be created without a physical stream
# Available source Types: DefaultSource, CSVSource, MQTTSource, SenseSource, OPCSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                         ZMQSource (ToDo: Make source available), KafkaSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                         BinarySource (ToDo: Make source available))
physicalSources:
  # Set logical stream name where this stream is added to
  - logicalSourceName: A
    # Set physical stream name
    physicalSourceName: A1
    # Define source type, also need to specify source configurations for source type below
    type: CSVSource
    # MQTTSource and its needed configuration params
