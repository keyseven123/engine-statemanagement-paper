/**
 * @brief This class holds a query plan shared by multiple queries i.e. from its source nodes we can reach the sink nodes of all
 * the queries participating in the shared query plan. A Global Query Plan can consists of multiple Shared Query Plans.
 * Additionally, a query con share only one Shared Query Plan within a Global Query Plan.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Example Query Plan:
 *
 *               {Q1}             {Q2}
 *             (Sink1)           (Sink2)
 *                |                 |
 *             (Map1)            (Map1)
 *                |                 |
 *            (Filter1)         (Filter1)
 *               |                 |
 *         (Source(Car))      (Source(Car))
 *
 * Shared Query Plan:
 *
 * sharedQueryPlanId: 1
 * queryPlan:
 *             (Sink1)       (Sink2)
 *                \          /
 *                  \      /
 *                     |
 *                  (Map1)
 *                    |
 *                (Filter1)
 *                   |
 *             (Source(Car))
 *
 * sharedQueryPlanId:
 *
 * queryIdToSinkOperatorMap:  {Q1:Sink1,Q2:Sink2}
 * queryIds: [Q1, Q2]
 * sinkOperators: [Sink1, Sink2]
 * deployed: false
 * newMetaData: true
 *
 * In the above Shared query plan, we have two QueryPlans with Sink1 and sink2 as respective sink nodes.
 * A SharedQueryPlan consists of a unique:
 *
 * - sharedQueryPlanId : this id is equivalent to the Query Id assigned to the user queryId. Since, there can be more than one query that can be merged
 *                      together we generate a unique Shared Query Id that can be associated to more than one Query Ids.
 * - queryPlan : the query plan for the shared query plan
 * - queryIdToSinkOperatorMap: the mapping among the query and the sink operator
 * - queryIds : A vector of original Query Ids participating in the shared query plan
 * - sinkOperators: A vector of sink operators in the query plan.
 * - deployed : A boolean flag indicating if the query plan is deployed or not.
 * - newMetaData : A boolean flag indicating if the meta data is a newly created one (i.e. it was never deployed before).
 *
