/**
 * @brief The TupleBuffer is the NES API that allows runtime components to access memory to store records
 * The purpose of the TupleBuffer is to zero memory allocations and enable batching. To zero the memory allocation
 * a BufferManager keeps a fixed set of fixed-size buffers that can be handed to components.
 * When a component is done with a buffer, it can be returned to the BufferManager.
 * However, the multi-threaded nature of NES execution engine introduces the challenge of reference counting: i.e.,
 * if a tuple buffer is shared among threads, we need to safely determine when the TupleBuffer can be returned to the
 * BufferManager. Our solution is as follows. We follow the same principle behind std::shared_ptr.
 * We use the TupleBuffer as a normal lvalue. Note that TupleBuffer* is forbidden and operator& of TupleBuffer is deleted.
 * We increase the reference counter of the TupleBuffer every time it gets passed via a copy ctor or a copy assignment
 * operator. When the dtor of a TupleBuffer is called then the reference counter is decreased.
 * To pass the TupleBuffer within a thread, a TupleBuffer& must be used.
 * To pass the TupleBuffer among thread, use TupleBuffer. Ensure the copy semantics is used. The move semantics is enabled
 * but that does not increase the internal counter.
 * Important note: when a component is done with a TupleBuffer, it must be released. Not returning a TupleBuffer will
 * result in a runtime error that the BufferManager will raise by the termination of the NES program.
 *
 * Reminder: this class should be header-only to help inlining
