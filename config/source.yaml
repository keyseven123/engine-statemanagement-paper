# ~~~ Configurations for the Data Source ~~~

# ~~ Source Handling ~~

# Set number of buffers to produce, i.e. how often the read csv file is repeated
numberOfBuffersToProduce: 1

# Set number of tuples to produce per buffer
numberOfTuplesToProducePerBuffer: 1

# Set physical stream name
physicalStreamName: default_stream_phy

# Set logical stream name where this stream is added to
logicalStreamName: default_stream_log

# Set sampling frequency of source
sourceFrequency: 1

# Set storage layout, true = row layout, false = column layout
rowLayout: true

# Set input data format
inputFormat: JSON

# Set the source type (available options: NoSource, DefaultSource, CSVSource, MQTTSource, SenseSource, OPCSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                                         ZMQSource (ToDo: Make source available), KafkaSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                                         BinarySource (ToDo: Make source available))
# NoSource: The worker will create a default source but no physical stream will be associated with it
sourceType: NoSource

# DefaultSource: A simple source with default data created inside NES, useful for testing
# numberOfBuffersToProduce defines how often the default data is repeated for this source
DefaultSource:

# SenseSource: Creates a Sense source
