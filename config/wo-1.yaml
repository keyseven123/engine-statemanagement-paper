# ~~~ Configurations for the NES Worker ~~~

# ~~ IPs and Ports ~~
# Set worker IP
#localWorkerIp: 127.0.0.1

# Set IP address of NES Coordinator to which the NES Worker should connect
#coordinatorIp: 127.0.0.1

# Set RPC Server port of NES Coordinator to which the NES Worker should connect
# Needs to be the same as rpcPort in Coordinator
#coordinatorPort: 4000

# Set RPC server port of NES Worker
#rpcPort: 3000

# Set the data port of the NES Worker
#dataPort: 3001

# ~~~ Physical Stream Configurations ~~~

# A Physical Stream may be associated with multiple Instances of a logicalStreamName, a physicalStreamName and a SourceType
# If no Physical Stream Config is given, the worker will be created without a physical stream
# Available source Types: DefaultSource, CSVSource, MQTTSource, SenseSource, OPCSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                         ZMQSource (ToDo: Make source available), KafkaSource (ToDo: Make source available),
#                         BinarySource (ToDo: Make source available))
