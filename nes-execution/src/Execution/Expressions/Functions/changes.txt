MEOS is a C library, threfore we can call it from Nebula.
String convertion is needed.
Since nebulaStream uses linux timestamp without timezone, I had to convert inside the expression implementation the time to this format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" and add the timezone as UTC. 
In the futute, I will explore a better integration by using MEOS to convert the times.

What is currently missing in my implementation is to define a custom aggregation function. 
For instance, I need call MEOS and look for the nearest neigbor between elements in the stream.

- Expression types
    TernaryExpressionNode for functions with three parameters (timestamp, latitude and longitude)
    SenaryExpressionNode for functions with six parameters (timestamp1, latitude1, longitude1,timestamp2, latitude2, longitude2)


- Expression/Functions types
    MeosSenaryFunction
    MeosTernaryFunctionTdwithin

    Ternary Operator for functions with three parameters (timestamp, latitude and longitude)
    Senary Operator for functions with six parameters (timestamp1, latitude1, longitude1,timestamp2, latitude2, longitude2)


- Integration queries 
1. Alert Filtering - a train is within a maintenance area, alerts are filtered out. We have obtained throughput of 2.24 MB with 20K events per second.
2. Noise Impact Analysis â€“ Monitors noise levels and correlates them with train positions. We have obtained throughput of 2.24 MB with 20K events per second.
3. Battery Monitoring - monitoring battery usage to prevent overheating and excessive discharge. We have obtained a throughput of 0.61 MB with 8K events per second.
4. Heavy load of passengers - detects if there are too many passengers, so more trains can be added. We have obtained a throughput of 3.68 MB with 32K events per second.
5. Unscheduled stops - system emits alerts if the train is stopped outside a station or workshop. We have a throughput of 0.40 MB with 10K events per second.
6. Monitoring breaks - system emits alerts when it detects repeated emergency brakes in specific track segments or low-pressure readings that could indicate a decrease in the break effectiveness. We achieved a throughput of 2.24 MB with 20K events per second.

There are three main sensor installed in each train (GPS, Break pressure and Battery).
Here is an except of the dataset:
time_utc,device_id,Vbat,PCFA_mbar,PCFF_mbar,PCF1_mbar,PCF2_mbar,T1_mbar,T2_mbar,Code1,Code2,gps_speed,gps_lat,gps_lon
1722520348,3,29.4,4.376,1.451,0.003,1.316,46.18,4.518,0.0,1296.0,1.4671,50.6456,4.3658
1722520348,5,29.7,5.043,0.0,0.011,0.0,39.81,3.462,0.0,1024.0,94.9161,51.3001,4.4325
1722520358,5,29.7,5.043,0.0,0.003,0.0,39.75,3.493,0.0,1024.0,97.5431,51.3024,4.4318

device_id is the id of the edge device that recieves all reading.
Vbat is the train battery voltage.
PCFA_mbar,PCFF_mbar,PCF1_mbar,PCF2_mbar,T1_mbar,T2_mbar are reading from the break sensor.
Code1,Code2 are used to define if there are any know errors in the train system.
